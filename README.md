# Simple JavaScript Implementation of FizzBuzz

This project is a classic implementation of the FizzBuzz exercise, used here both as a refresher in JavaScript and as a demonstration of my current development practices and environment setup.

The original version was inspired by Michael Hartl's [Learn Enough JavaScript to Be Dangerous](https://www.learnenough.com/javascript-tutorial-tutorial/) tutorial.

# Purpose

This project is part of my personal journey as I prepare to apply to CodeSmith. It represents my current JavaScript proficiency (beginner level) — including areas where I know my style still leans on habits from other languages.

Where possible, I’ve adopted common JavaScript idioms, but you’ll also notice places where I’ve used more verbose if/else logic or procedural constructs. I’ve left these as-is intentionally to reflect an honest snapshot of where I am today — not a polished "interview artifact," but real working code with structure, tests, and automation.

# Execution

- Run the program:
  ```bash
  npm start
  ```

- Run tests:
  ```bash
  npm test
  ```
